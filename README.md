# Cuphead Mods

* Basically, my collection of cuphead (mainly script) mods that I made lol

* All of these as of rn use the legacy ver (idk which ver tho since when I made this mine was pirated (someone remind me to reinstall cuphead and see which ver the mod works on) lmao.)

# Mods

* The Massive Skill Issue - A mod that makes every weapon super overpowered (haha one hit kill), it also makes the one up charm give 69 health instead of 1 lolz.
